This is a history of changes that affect users and maintainers of
proiel-webapp. It does not list all changes; see the git history for that.

  - Support for <sup>, <sub> and <i> in token forms and presentation strings.

  - Under-the-hood changes to ease transition to upcoming 2.0 version.
  - SVG is now the default for graph visualisations.
  - Added caching of frequently computed source division values. This
    introduces another scheduled job that must run regularly to keep the cache
    synchronised with changes in the database.

1.8.1   15/03/2016

  - Fixed incorrect removal of parts of the export job.

1.8.0   07/03/2016

  - proiel:text:export now exports texts to the current directory by default
    unless overridden by an environment variable.
  - Exporter job has been removed since the jobs over time get too heavy to
    run without proper supervision.
  - Changed default production web server from thin to unicorn.

1.7.1   16/03/2016

  - Fixed broken tokenization of tokens with certain Unicode characters.

1.7.0   13/02/2016

    token splitting less tedious.

  - Removed plugin system --- it was never used much.
  - Removed link mapper for Bibelen.no as site no longer uses predictable

    completed.

    existing ID attributes.
  - The following functionality has been removed and delegated to proiel-cli:
      - automatic validation of exported files
      - option to export only reviewed sentences (note that this also
        means that the files that can be downloaded from the 'Downloads'
        area now contain both reviewed and unreviewed data)

      - raw text importer

    will be silently dropped.
  - PROIEL XML updated to version 2.0. Version 2.0 is not backwards compatible
    with version 1.0. PROIEL XML 1.0 can still be imported but all exports are
