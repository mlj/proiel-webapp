= The PROIEL web application

The PROIEL web application used the Ruby on Rails framework. If you are
unfamiliar with this, you should consulta general introduction to Ruby on
Rails first. link:http://rubyonrails.org/ and
linkhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/ are good starting points. Note that this
version of the PROIEL web application requires Rails 2.3.x.

== Installation

If you already have Ruby, RubyGems and Ruby on Rails installed,
installation of the PROIEL web application consist of the following steps.

=== Step 1: Dependencies

The application has a number of other dependencies that should be handled
automatically by Rails' dependency tracker. Use

    rake gems:install

to have the dependency tracker automatically install all dependencies.

You should also install +graphviz+ from link:http://www.graphviz.org/ to
get dependency graph visualisations. Version 2.26.3 is known to work with
this release of the PROIEL application, but more recent versions should
also work. +graphviz+ must be compiled with SVG support. The recommended
configuration settings are

    --with-fontconfig --with-freetype2 --with-pangocairo --with-rsvg

=== Step 2: Generate support files

Before starting the application for the first time, you must run
    make -C lib
to build the support files.

== Step 3: Configure the database

Copy +config/database.yml.example+ to +config/database.yml+ and customize
if needed. The default setup creates SQLite databases in the +db+
directory.

Initialize a new database by running

    $ rake db:setup

Add an administrator account. This should be done using Rails' console
interface:

    $ ./script/console
    Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.8)
    >> u = User.new :login => "username", :first_name => "Foo", :last_name => "Bar", :email => "foo@bar", :password => "foo"
    >> u.role_id = 4
    >> u.save!
    >> u.confirm!

=== Step 4: Set run-time configuration settings

Inspect +config/app_config.yml+ and make changes as necessary. It is
essential that you change the +base_url+ and the +dc_*+ fields.

=== Step 5 (optional): Enable morphological rules

If you plan to compile your own morphological rules, you will need the
+SFST+ toolkit from
link:http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html.
This release of the PROIEL web application is designed to work with version
1.3 of +SFST+.
