Short-cut keys
==============

Using access keys you can quickly navigate directly to a specific page
or part of a page using the keyboard. In most browsers you will have
to hold down the <abbr title="Control">Ctrl</abbr> and
<abbr>Alt</abbr> keys and simultaneously press one of the access keys
listed below. If this does not work in your browser, you can see if
[the Wikipedia page on Access keys]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_keys) explains the procedure for
your browser.
